# DiscordMobileDetective

Discord Mobile Detective is a Discord bot created to detect when people open discord on their mobile.

Now to get a leg up in this game me and another programming friend decided to create this bot that would automatically detect when someone went onto their mobile and post it publicly in the server for all to see. Not only that, it also keeps track of the number of times someone gets caight, adding salt to the wounds.
